I've been hearing this a lot lately: "Video is important" and "we should do a video for that" and "we need to see more videos on our homepage".

I'm all about producing and publishing compelling video content but I'm not sure the people urgently requesting them are asking these questions: 
- "Is the cost of putting this video together worth its potential benefits"?
- "Could this message be more effective using photography."
- "Who will actually watch this video?"
